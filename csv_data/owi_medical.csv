K191217,Bone fixation cerclage,JAZZ PF,21 CFR 888.3010,Class II,OWI,"JAZZ PF enables the passing of a JAZZ braid around or through the upper spinous process. The
   main difference with the JAZZ regular connector is that in the subject device the braid is locked
   horizontally, that is, along the spine axis, instead of vertically. On each side of the instrumented
   levels, a JAZZ PF connector is implanted on the union rod below the upper pedicle screw. A JAZZ
   braid is passed and locked through a 1st connector, above or through the spinous process and
   back through the second connector on the other side. The slack that can exist in the band is
   removed using the JAZZ PF Band Reducer (Enrouleur Instrument) without applying any tension
   in the band and the 2nd connector is locked. By doing so, flexion is controlled which helps in the
   primary stabilization of the levels where fusion has to be achieved.","The JAZZ systems (including the JAZZ Claw Connector) are temporary implants to be used in orthopedic surgery.
The JAZZ systems are intended to provide temporary stabilization as a bone anchor during the development of solid
bony fusion and aid in the repair of bone fractures.
The indications for use include the following applications:
1. Spinal trauma surgery, used in sublaminar or facet wiring techniques;
2. Spinal reconstructive surgery, incorporated into constructs for the purpose of correction of spinal deformities
such as adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, adult scoliosis, kyphosis and spondylolisthesis;
3. Spinal degenerative surgery, as an adjunct to spinal fusions.
The JAZZ Systems may also be used in conjunction with other medical implants made of titanium alloy or Cobaltchromium-molybdenum alloy whenever ""wiring"" may help secure the attachment of other implants.","The JAZZ PF is an additional component of the JAZZ System that was cleared under K182771.
   The proposed device uses similar technological characteristics of braided bands and clamps as
   the primary predicate, VersaTie System, to stabilize the spine. Specifically, the subject device,
   similar to the NuVasive VersaTie System, is secured around posterior vertebral structures such
   as the lamina, facet, transverse processes, and spinous process from T1-L5. The system is
   comprised of braided bands and clamps designed to attach to c rods.

Dear Ms. Kichula:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act.
The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of",

K191217,Bone fixation cerclage,JAZZ PF,21 CFR 888.3010,Class II,OWI,"JAZZ PF enables the passing of a JAZZ braid around or through the upper spinous process. The
   main difference with the JAZZ regular connector is that in the subject device the braid is locked
   horizontally, that is, along the spine axis, instead of vertically. On each side of the instrumented
   levels, a JAZZ PF connector is implanted on the union rod below the upper pedicle screw. A JAZZ
   braid is passed and locked through a 1st connector, above or through the spinous process and
   back through the second connector on the other side. The slack that can exist in the band is
   removed using the JAZZ PF Band Reducer (Enrouleur Instrument) without applying any tension
   in the band and the 2nd connector is locked. By doing so, flexion is controlled which helps in the
   primary stabilization of the levels where fusion has to be achieved.","The JAZZ systems (including the JAZZ Claw Connector) are temporary implants to be used in orthopedic surgery.
The JAZZ systems are intended to provide temporary stabilization as a bone anchor during the development of solid
bony fusion and aid in the repair of bone fractures.
The indications for use include the following applications:
1. Spinal trauma surgery, used in sublaminar or facet wiring techniques;
2. Spinal reconstructive surgery, incorporated into constructs for the purpose of correction of spinal deformities
such as adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, adult scoliosis, kyphosis and spondylolisthesis;
3. Spinal degenerative surgery, as an adjunct to spinal fusions.
The JAZZ Systems may also be used in conjunction with other medical implants made of titanium alloy or Cobaltchromium-molybdenum alloy whenever ""wiring"" may help secure the attachment of other implants.","The JAZZ PF is an additional component of the JAZZ System that was cleared under K182771.
   The proposed device uses similar technological characteristics of braided bands and clamps as
   the primary predicate, VersaTie System, to stabilize the spine. Specifically, the subject device,
   similar to the NuVasive VersaTie System, is secured around posterior vertebral structures such
   as the lamina, facet, transverse processes, and spinous process from T1-L5. The system is
   comprised of braided bands and clamps designed to attach to c rods.
